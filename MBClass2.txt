GitHub is a web-based hosting service for version control using Git that is mostly used for software code.
It offers all of the distributed version control and source code management functionality of Git as well as adding its own features.

Difference between Git merging and Git rebasing
- The main difference between git rebase and git merge is that git rebase creates a new set of commits applied on top of the target branch,
while git merge creates a new merge commit that combines the changes from both branches.

- Git merge is a way of combining changes from one branch (source branch) into another branch (target branch),
where as Git rebase is a way of moving the changes from one branch onto another branch.

### Difference between merging and rebasing

- Merging and rebasing are two ways to combine changes from different branches in Git.

- Merging creates a new commit that combines the changes from both branches. This new commit is then added to the main branch.

- Rebasing applies the changes from one branch to the other branch, effectively moving the changes from the first branch onto the second branch. This can be useful for cleaning up the history of a branch or for integrating changes from a remote branch.

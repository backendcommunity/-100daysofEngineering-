**Events in Programming**:

An event is an action or occurrence recognized by a program, and the program can react to these events. 

Events can be triggered by a user's actions, such as clicking on a button or typing, or they can be generated by the program itself.

**Event Listeners and Handlers**:

When an event occurs, the program generates a signal. Event listeners are responsible for monitoring these events as they happen and passing them on to event handlers. Event handlers, on the other hand, are blocks of code designed to respond to and handle these events. They are attached to the events and execute specific actions in response to the events passed by the event listener. Event handlers enable the program to react and respond effectively to various user actions and other events in the program's execution.


##The Event Loop

JavaScript (JS) is a single-threaded language, which means it can execute one operation at a time.

**The Call Stack**:

- The call stack is a data structure that records where the program is in its execution.
- It operates on a Last-In, First-Out (LIFO) principle, which means the last operation pushed onto the stack is the first to be executed.
- It manages the global execution context (where the program starts and executes) and function execution contexts (created for each function call).

**Blocking**:

- Blocking refers to operations or code blocks that are slow and may take a significant amount of time to execute.

**Concurrency**:

- Concurrency is the ability to execute multiple tasks or operations at seemingly the same time, even in a single-threaded environment.
- The event loop is a critical component for achieving concurrency in JavaScript.

**The Event Loop**:

- The event loop constantly monitors the call stack and the task queue (also known as the callback queue).
- When the call stack is empty (no synchronous code is executing), the event loop checks the task queue.
- Any pending tasks in the task queue are pushed onto the call stack for execution and are later removed from the stack.

**Non-Blocking I/O**:

- The event loop allows JavaScript to perform non-blocking input-output (I/O) operations.
- In Node.js, blocking operations like reading/writing files or networking tasks are offloaded to the operating system kernel, which often handles them in a multithreaded manner.
- The results of these operations are then sent to the callback queue for further processing.




Event driven architecture
Event-driven architecture is a softwqre design pattern taht enables an organisation to detect events and act on them in real time

EDA is often refered to as asynchronous communicationi because the sender and recipient do not have to wait for each other to move onto their next task. EDA is a shift from accumulating data and data lakes to focus on data in flight

EDAs have three key components: event producers, event routers/channels and event consumers.
A producer publishes/produces and event to the router
The router filters, ingests and pushes the event to the consmers. 
 
The asynchronous form of EDA suports a decoupled system, where producers are decooupled from conusermers. Producers don't know which consumers are listening for the events they are sending

EDA has two main Design patterns
- Publisher-Subscriber pattern
- Event streaming pattern

##Publisher-Subsriber pattern
Pub/Sub is a design pattern used for asynchronous communication between different components
It enables an application to announce events to multiple consumers asynchronously.
The sender packages events into messages and sends to the consumers and the consumers are known as the subscribers. The Sender here is called the publisher, messages are sent through intermediaries called message brokers which groups sthe messages into different topics (or channels). The consumers subscribe to this topics.

##Web hooks
These are automated messages that are sent from apps when something happens.
Web hooks are user defined callbacks made with an HTTP. Webhooks are data and executable commands sent from one app to another over HTTP. They are functions that run when something happens i.e. an event occurs
Webhooks are how a system updates another system about an event in real-time.
They are a means for automating responses in softwares and they are called event based APIs
They are used in social messaging apps, whereby when an event takes place such as sending a message, the sender triggers the webhook and almost immediately an update is sent to the receiver

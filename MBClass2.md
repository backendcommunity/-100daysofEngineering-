# GitHub Overview

GitHub is a web-based hosting service for version control using Git, primarily utilized for managing software code. It encompasses the full functionality of distributed version control and source code management offered by Git while introducing its unique features.

## Difference between Git Merging and Git Rebasing

- **Git Merging**: Combines changes from one branch (source) into another (target) by creating a new merge commit that integrates changes from both branches.
- **Git Rebasing**: Involves creating a new set of commits applied atop the target branch, essentially moving the changes from one branch onto another.

## Git Commands and Their Uses

- `git branch -m {name}`: Displays the current branch.
- `git checkout -b {name}`: Creates a new branch and switches to it.
- `git add .`: Adds files to the staging area.
- `git status`: Checks the status of files in the staging area.
- `git commit -m {message}`: Moves files to the HEAD before sending them to the remote repository.
- `git push origin {name}`: Sends files to the remote repository on GitHub.
- `git pull origin {name}`: Retrieves files from the remote repository.

# Difference Between Git Merge And Rebase

It is widely advised that git merge should be used rather than git rebase because of the inconsistent repositories that would be caused by git rebase. 
1. When you rebase a feature branch onto a main, you move the base of the feature branch to the main branchâ€™s ending point.
2. Merging takes the contents of the feature branch and integrates it with the main branch. As a result, only the main branch is changed. The feature branch history remains the same.

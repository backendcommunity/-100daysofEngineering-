- Git Merge: The `git merge` command combines the changes from one branch into another branch, creating a new commit with both branch's changes. It Integrates changes from one branch into another, creating a new merge commit and maintaining the original branch structure. It's good for preserving history and is suitable for shared branches.
- Git Rebase: The `git rebase` command rewrites the commit history by moving the starting point of the current branch to the tip of another branch. It Rewrites commit history by applying the commits on top of another branch, resulting in a linear history. It's great for a cleaner history but might cause issues in shared branches due to history rewriting.â€¨
  The choice between them depends on whether you prioritise a clean, linear history (rebase) or preserving the original branch structure (merge), considering the impact on shared branches and collaboration.
